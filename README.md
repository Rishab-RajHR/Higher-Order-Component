A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is an advanced React pattern for reusing component logic

It is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component

Commonly used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, logging, and data fetching

Helps keep components clean and focused by separating logic from UI

Does not modify the original component; instead, it wraps it

Promotes code reusability and maintainability

Follows the naming convention withFeature(Component)

Widely used in older React patterns and libraries, alongside Hooks in modern apps
